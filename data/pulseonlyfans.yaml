  with a groundbreaking staking and reflection system, making hodling $FAN
  tokens the sexiest move."
description: PulseOnlyFans is like the hottest mix on PulseChain, striving to
  make PulseChain even sexier than it already is! Inspired by the buzz around
  trending ERC-404 tokens, but harnessing superior technology a threesome of
  smart contracts. One serves up simple trading as an ERC-20 token, ensuring
  smooth onboarding and lightning-fast liquidity. The second contract is a true
  NFT gem, perfect for collectors, with a limited supply of just 5555 true
  ERC-721 NFTs. And last but certainly not least, we've got the sexiest contract
  of them all – the staking contract, designed to reward stakers with
  reflections from every trade. Whenever anyone swaps some $FAN tokens, a
  tantalizing portion gets taxed and transformed into rewards for our devoted
  $FAN stakers. We're launching $FAN with a bold tax to keep things spicy and
  deter any would-be jeeters, but fear not – it'll gradually cool down each day
  until it settles at a tantalizing 5%. Holding onto those $FAN tokens isn't
  just a smart and sexiest move, it's downright scorching!
