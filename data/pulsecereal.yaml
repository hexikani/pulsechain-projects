  meme: "Pulse Cerealâ€™s functionalities have 3 points of interest. 1. Automatic
    Reflection Redistribution: The smart contract automatically redistributes
    $Cereal tokens to all existing holders with each transaction. 2.
    Deflationary: 40% of $CEREAL supply burned at launch will cause a
    deflationary movement by the reflections the burn wallet will gain. This
    makes the asset more scarce overtime. 3. The smart contract automatically
    adds value to the existing liquidity pools with each transaction
    made.  Transaction Fees: 2% per transaction Redistribution: 1% of each
    transaction redistributed to existing token holders Liquidity Pool: 1% of
    each transaction added to the liquidity pool. (Deflationary, No Admin Keys,
    Contract Renounced)"
