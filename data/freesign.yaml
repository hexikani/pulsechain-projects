description: '"Points have no value. You must have no expectations. You get
  nothing. You proved your belief in the freedom to sign. You did not send from
  an exchange. You used your own keys as your signature to publish your address
  in a set of free speech users. You signed the list of what I most deeply
  believe in. See tweet for full details." x.com/MatiALLin '
