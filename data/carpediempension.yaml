  rules that can never be changed. Not by anyone. Never.

  It is currently under development and is planned to launch on Pulsechain in 2024. 


  ##Carpe Diem Pension: 

  - pays out indefinitely through a decentralized and immutable smartcontract

  - does not play around with your money. You manage your own pension through the smartcontract

  - starts paying out from the moment you make your first deposit

  - allows you to literally build up your pension payout through accumulation of deposits. You increase the payout by depositing more and more each month.

  - is transferable without restrictions (by sharing access to your wallet address)

  - deposits and withdrawals are in CDP
